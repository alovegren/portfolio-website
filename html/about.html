I am a graphic designer, illustrator and artist living in Falls Church, VA, and my passion lies in telling stories. It’s likely that picture books made me love to draw at an early age, and today they remain some of my biggest inspirations. My heroes are still storytellers: Miyazaki, Sendak, Gorey, those who work in that special realm fueled by the imaginative cleverness of children. <!--Of course as my love for pictures grew into a preoccupation for art, my influences grew to include painters like Van Gogh, Matisse, Monet, Gagnon. My tastes may be old-fashioned, but still what takes my breath away in a museum are those old impressionist and landscape paintings.-->

I strive for simplicity in my work, but to tell the truth I usually end up carried away in the joy of mark-making and color and rich detail. While the battle between intention and what seems to be my own nature can be frustrating, I like to think that the complexity that arises organically in my work ends up being a strong point.

As my profession has grown to include a great deal of design (from infographics to stationery to brand identity), so my artwork has been influenced and my brain has been molded. I believe my experience as a graphic designer has strengthened my sense of harmony and balance, and fine tuned my ability to choose color.
<!--As a student, I have the freedom to work in whatever realm I please, but I am beginning to have more and more experiences with applying my work in other fields, from educational and promotional graphic design to freelance animation and brand design. As my experiences grow, I feel more and more strongly that I want to work in creative illustration and animation; I’ve found these fields to be powerfully evocative ways to explore the things I love: storytelling, cuisine, history, ecology, language, humor, and the many intersections between these.-->

In short, it’s a joy to make and share my work with you! If you'd like to talk projects or commissions, or just get in touch, email me at <span style="color:#f75180">audrey.lovegren@utexas.edu</span>.
